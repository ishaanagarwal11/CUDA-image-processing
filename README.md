This project compares image processing done with CUDA C (using GPUs) and traditional C (using CPUs). We're looking at common image processing tasks like edge detection, blur, sharpening, and applying color filters.

We want to see which method is faster and more efficient. We'll measure things like how long it takes to process images, how well it handles different image sizes, and how it performs in real-time applications.

By comparing CUDA C and traditional C, we aim to understand their strengths and weaknesses. This will help people choose the best method for their image processing needs, which could improve tasks like object recognition and medical diagnostics.
